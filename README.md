# MoebelHuset
 
I have created a simple website using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to take a [Figma design](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/furniture-website-design-ui-concept) and code it. However, I made some modifications to the design to make it more personal and authentic to me. While looking back at the project, I realized that there are some changes I could make to achieve the same styling with less code and better responsiveness. However, overall I am satisfied with the [outcome](https://mariangle.github.io/MoebelHuset/) of the project.
