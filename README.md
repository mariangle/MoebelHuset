I've created a simple website using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to take a [Figma design](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/furniture-website-design-ui-concept) and code it. However, I've made some modifications to the design to make it more personal and authentic. Looking back at the project, I realize that there are some changes that could been made to achieve better styling with less code and improved responsiveness. However, overall I am satisfied with the [outcome](https://mariangle.github.io/figma-design-clone/) of the project.
